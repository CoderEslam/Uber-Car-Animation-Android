This project contains a sample app that shows how to animate the car icon of Uber app from a Source to a Destination on Google Map. We will build the following in this project:  
* Use Google Map to draw path from Origin to Destination
* Use list of locations to draw a path between Origin and Destination just like Uber
* Use list of location to update car location 
* Use LinearInterpolator for animation
* Draw one path of two colours i.e. grey and black
* Animate the black path from Origin to Destination just like Uber application
* Animate the car icon just like Uber application

## Building the project
* Clone the project, the `master` branch has the latest code.
* This App uses the Google API Key for Maps. Get the API key from the Google Cloud Developer console after enabling the Maps feature for your project. Refer this [link](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/directions/get-api-key) and put that API key in the `AndroidManifest.xml` file in your project:
The `meta-data` tag of `AndroidManifest.xml` file will look like below:
```
<meta-data
            android:name="com.google.android.geo.API_KEY"
            android:value="PASTE_YOUR_API_KEY_HERE" />
```
